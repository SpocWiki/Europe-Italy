> **Pompeii** (pom-PAY(-ee); Latin: [pɔmˈpei̯.iː]) was a city in what is now the municipality of Pompei, 
> near Naples, in the Campania region of Italy. 
> 
> Along with Herculaneum, Stabiae, and many surrounding villas, 
> the city was buried under 4 to 6 m (13 to 20 ft) of volcanic ash and pumice 
> in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD.
>
> Largely preserved under the ash, Pompeii offers a unique snapshot of Roman life, 
> frozen at the moment it was buried, as well as insight into ancient urban planning. 
> 
> It was a wealthy town of 10,000 to 20,000 residents at the time it was destroyed. 
> It hosted many fine public buildings and luxurious private houses 
> with lavish decorations, furnishings and artworks, 
> which were the main attractions for early excavators; 
> subsequent excavations have found hundreds of private homes and businesses 
> reflecting various architectural styles and social classes, as well as numerous public buildings. 
> 
> Organic remains, including wooden objects and human bodies, were interred in the ash; 
> their eventual decay allowed archaeologists to create 
> moulds of figures in their final moments of life. 
> 
> The numerous graffiti carved on outside walls and inside rooms 
> provide a wealth of examples of the largely lost Vulgar Latin spoken colloquially at the time, 
> contrasting with the formal language of classical writers.
>
> Following its destruction, Pompeii remained largely undisturbed 
> until its rediscovery in the late 16th century. 
> 
> Major excavations did not begin until the mid-18th century, 
> which marked the emergence of modern archeology; 
> initial efforts to unearth the city were haphazard or marred by looting, 
> resulting in many items or sites being damaged or destroyed. 
> 
> By 1960, most of Pompeii had been uncovered but left in decay; 
> further major excavations were banned or limited to targeted, prioritised areas. 
> Since 2018, these efforts have led to new discoveries in some previously unexplored areas of the city.
>
> Pompeii is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, owing to its status as 
> "the only archaeological site in the world that provides a complete picture of an ancient Roman city." 
> 
> It is among the most popular tourist attractions in Italy, with approximately 2.5 million visitors annually.
