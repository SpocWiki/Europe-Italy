> The Palazzo Pitti (Italian: [paˈlattso ˈpitti]), in English sometimes called the Pitti Palace, 
> is a vast, mainly Renaissance, palace in Florence, Italy. 
> 
> It is situated on the south side of the River Arno, a short distance from the Ponte Vecchio. 
> The core of the present palazzo dates from 1458 
> and was originally the town residence of Luca Pitti, an ambitious Florentine banker.
>
> The palace was bought by the Medici family in 1549 
> and became the chief residence of the ruling family of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. 
> It grew as a great treasure house, for generations amassing paintings, plates, jewelry 
> and luxurious possessions. 
> The Medici also added the extensive Boboli Gardens to the palace estate.
>
> In the late 18th century, the palazzo was used 
> as a power base by Napoleon during his conquests of Europe. 
> 
> For a brief period, it later served as 
> the principal royal palace of the newly united Italy under the House of Savoy. 
> The palace and its contents were donated to the Italian people 
> by King Victor Emmanuel III in 1919.
>
> The palazzo is now the largest museum complex in Florence. 
> The principal palazzo block, often in a building of this design known as the corps de logis, 
> is 32,000 square metres. 
> 
> It is divided into several principal galleries or museums detailed below.
>
> The Palazzo Pitti is an integral part of the Historic Centre of Florence, 
> which was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1982. 
> The palace exemplifies Florence's Renaissance heritage and urban continuity.
