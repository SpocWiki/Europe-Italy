> Italian: Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana), more commonly known as the Vatican Library 
> or informally as the Vat, is the library of the Holy See, located in Vatican City, 
> and is the city-state's national library. 
> 
> It was formally established by Pope Sixtus IV on June 15, 1475, 
> by the papal bull Ad decorem militantis ecclesiae, although it is much older. 
> It is one of the oldest libraries in the world 
> and contains one of the most significant collections of historical texts. 
> It has 75,000 codices from throughout history, 
> as well as 1.1 million printed books, which include some 8,500 incunabula.
>
> The Vatican Library is a research library for history, law, philosophy, science, and theology. 
> 
> The Vatican Library is open 
> to anyone who can document their qualifications and research needs. 
> Photocopies for private study of pages from books published between 1801 and 1990 
> can be requested in person or by mail.
>
> Pope Nicholas V (1447–1455) envisioned a new Rome, 
> with extensive public works to lure pilgrims and scholars to the city 
> to begin its transformation. 
> 
> Nicolas wanted to create a "public library" for Rome 
> that was meant to be seen as an institution for humanist scholarship. 
> 
> His death prevented him from carrying out his plan, but his successor Pope Sixtus IV (1471–1484) established what is now known as the Vatican Library.
>
> In March 2014, the Vatican Library began an initial four-year project of 
> digitising its collection of manuscripts, to be made available online.
>
> The Vatican Apostolic Archive was separated from the library 
> at the beginning of the 17th century; it contains another 150,000 items.
