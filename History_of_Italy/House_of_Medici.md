## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The House of Medici (English:  MED-itch-ee, UK also  mə-DEE-chee; Italian: [ˈmɛːditʃi]) 
> was an Italian banking family and political dynasty that consolidated power 
> in the Republic of Florence under Cosimo de' Medici 
> and his grandson Lorenzo "the Magnificent" during the first half of the 15th century. 
> 
> The family originated in the Mugello region of Tuscany, 
> and prospered gradually in trade until it was able to fund the Medici Bank. 
> This bank was the largest in Europe in the 15th century 
> and facilitated the Medicis' rise to political power in Florence, 
> although they officially remained citizens rather than monarchs until the 16th century.
>
> In 1532, the family acquired the hereditary title Duke of Florence. 
> In 1569, the duchy was elevated to the Grand Duchy of Tuscany after territorial expansion. 
> The Medici ruled the Grand Duchy from its inception under the builder Cosimo I until 1737, 
> with the death of Gian Gastone de' Medici.  
> 
> The Medici produced four popes of the Catholic Church—Pope Leo X (1513–1521), Pope Clement VII (1523–1534), Pope Pius IV (1559–1565) and Pope Leo XI (1605)—
> and two queens of France—Catherine de' Medici (1547–1559) and Marie de' Medici (1600–1610). 
> The Medici's grand duchy witnessed degrees of economic growth under the early grand dukes, 
> but was bankrupt by the time of Cosimo III de' Medici (r. 1670–1723).
>
> The Medicis' wealth and influence was initially derived from the textile trade 
> guided by the wool guild of Florence, the Arte della Lana. 
> Like other families ruling in Italian signorie, the Medici dominated their city's government, 
> were able to bring Florence under their family's power, 
> and created an environment in which art and humanism flourished. 
> The Italian Renaissance was inspired by the Medici along with other families of Italy, 
> such as the Visconti and Sforza in Milan, the Este in Ferrara, the Borgia and Della Rovere in Rome, 
> and the Gonzaga in Mantua.
>
> The Medici Bank, from when it was created in 1397 to its fall in 1494, 
> was one of the most prosperous and respected institutions in Europe, 
> and the Medici family was considered the wealthiest in Europe for a time. 
> From this base, they acquired political power initially in Florence 
> and later in wider Italy and Europe. 
> They were among the earliest businesses to use the general ledger system of accounting 
> through the development of the double-entry bookkeeping system for tracking credits and debits.
>
> The Medici family financed the construction of Saint Peter's Basilica and Florence Cathedral, 
> and were patrons of Donatello, Brunelleschi, Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, 
> Raphael, Machiavelli, Galileo, and Francesco Redi, among many others in the arts and sciences.  
> 
> They funded the invention of the piano, and arguably that of opera.  
> They were also protagonists of the Counter-Reformation, from the beginning of the Reformation 
> through the Council of Trent and the French Wars of Religion.
