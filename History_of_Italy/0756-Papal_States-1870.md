## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> The Papal States ( PAY-pəl; Italian: Stato Pontificio; Latin: Dicio Pontificia), 
> officially the State of the Church, were a conglomeration of territories on the Italian peninsula 
> under the direct sovereign rule of the pope from 756 to 1870. 
> 
> They were among the major states of Italy from the 8th century until the unification of Italy, 
> which took place between 1859 and 1870, culminating in their demise.
>
> The state was legally established in the 8th century when Pepin the Short, king of the Franks, 
> gave Pope Stephen II, as a temporal sovereign, 
> lands formerly held by Arian Christian Lombards, adding them to lands 
> and other real estate formerly acquired and held by the bishops of Rome 
> as landlords from the time of Constantine onward. 
> 
> This donation came about as part of a process 
> whereby the popes began to turn away from the Byzantine emperors 
> as their foremost temporal guardians for reasons such as increased imperial taxes, 
> disagreement with respect to iconoclasm, and failure of the emperors, 
> or their exarchs in Italy, to protect Rome and the rest of the peninsula from barbarian invasion and pillage.
>
> During the Renaissance, the papal territory expanded greatly, 
> and the pope became one of Italy's most important rulers as well as the head of Western Christianity. 
> 
> At their zenith, the Papal States covered most of the modern Italian regions of Lazio 
> (which includes Rome), Marche, Umbria, Romagna, and portions of Emilia. 
> The popes' reign over these lands was an exemplification of their temporal powers 
> as secular rulers, as opposed to their ecclesiastical primacy.
>
> By 1860, much of the Papal States' territory had been conquered by the Kingdom of Italy, 
> except Lazio, which remained under the pope's control. 
> 
> By 1870, only the Leonine City within Rome was retained, 
> the Italian kingdom refraining from occupying it militarily, despite its annexation. 
> 
> In 1929, the Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini, the head of the Italian government, 
> ended the "Prisoner in the Vatican" period by negotiating the Lateran Treaty, 
> signed by the two parties. 
> 
> This treaty acknowledged the sovereignty of the Holy See 
> over a newly created territorial entity, a city-state within Rome limited to a token territory, 
> the Vatican City, with the pope as its sovereign.
