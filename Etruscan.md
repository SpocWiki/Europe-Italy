> The Etruscan civilization ( ih-TRUS-kən) was an ancient civilization created by the **Etruscans**, 
> a people who inhabited Etruria in ancient Italy, with a common language and culture, 
> and formed a federation of city-states. 
> 
> After adjacent lands had been conquered, its territory covered, at its greatest extent, 
> roughly what is now Tuscany, western Umbria and northern Lazio, 
> as well as what are now the Po Valley, Emilia-Romagna, south-eastern Lombardy, 
> southern Veneto and western Campania.
>
> A large body of literature has flourished on the origins of the Etruscans, 
> but the consensus among modern scholars is that the Etruscans were an indigenous population. 
> 
> The earliest evidence of a culture that is identifiably Etruscan dates from about 900 BC. 
> This is the period of the Iron Age Villanovan culture, 
> considered to be the earliest phase of Etruscan civilization, 
> which itself developed from the previous late Bronze Age Proto-Villanovan culture 
> in the same region, part of the central European Urnfield culture system. 
> 
> Etruscan civilization dominated Italy until it fell to the expanding Rome 
> beginning in the late 4th century BC as a result of the Roman–Etruscan Wars; 
> Etruscans were granted Roman citizenship in 90 BC 
> and in 27 BC the whole Etruscan territory was incorporated into the newly established Roman Empire.
>
> The territorial extent of Etruscan civilization reached its maximum around 500 BC, 
> shortly after the Roman Kingdom became the Roman Republic. 
> 
> Its culture flourished in three confederacies of cities: 
> - that of Etruria (Tuscany, Latium and Umbria), 
> - that of the Po Valley with the eastern Alps, and 
> - that of Campania. 
> 
> The league in northern Italy is mentioned in Livy. 
> The reduction in Etruscan territory was gradual, 
> but after 500 BC the political balance of power on the Italian peninsula 
> shifted away from the Etruscans in favor of the rising Roman Republic.
>
> The earliest-known examples of Etruscan writing are inscriptions found in southern Etruria 
> that date to around 700 BC. 
> 
> The Etruscans developed a system of writing derived from the Euboean alphabet, 
> which was used in the Magna Graecia coastal areas in Southern Italy. 
> The Etruscan language remains only partly understood, 
> making modern understanding of their society and culture heavily dependent on 
> much later and generally disapproving Roman and Greek sources. 
> 
> In the Etruscan political system authority resided in its individual small cities 
> and probably in its prominent individual families. 
> 
> At the height of Etruscan power, elite Etruscan families grew very rich 
> through trade with the Celts to the north and the Greeks to the south, 
> and they filled their large family tombs with imported luxuries.
